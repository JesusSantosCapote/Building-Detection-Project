# Detection of Buildings from Satellite Images with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting buildings from satellite images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We trained two types of models: an object detection model and two classifiers, using the Functional Map of the World (FMoW) dataset to detect certain types of buildings in satellite images.

## Models
### Object Detection Model
- **Architecture**: Faster R-CNN
- **Purpose**: Identify and locate buildings within satellite images.

### Classifiers
We utilized four different convolutional neural network architectures for classification:
- **DenseNet**
- **ResNet**
- **InceptionV3**
- **Xception**

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Platform**: Trained on Google Colab
